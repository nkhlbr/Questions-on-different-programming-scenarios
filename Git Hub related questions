Changing the Repo Language Shown
Now that we know the background of how GitHub determines the repository language, I’ll show you how to change the language shown using gitattributes.

Create a .gitattributes file in your repo at the top-level
Edit the file and add the below line, subbing in the language(s) you want ignored denoted by its file extension before linguist-detectable=false. Since I want HTML ignored, I’ve included HTML below.
*.html linguist-detectable=false
Add, commit, and push the changes

And voila, the language is changed to JavaScript!
